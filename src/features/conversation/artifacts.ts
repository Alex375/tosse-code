// `Artifact` tool_use inputs (file_path / description / favicon / label) joined to their

// tool_use + tool_result are replayed from the transcript by history.rs, so a resumed
// conversation surfaces the same artifacts as a live one — for free.
//
// READ-ONLY toward claude.ai: this only reads what was already published; it never issues
// an `Artifact` publish/list call (that would be a real side-effect on the user's account).

/**
 * Pure: walk a session's timeline and group every `Artifact` publish into one {@link Artifact}
 * per file_path, oldest→newest.
 *
 * Design choices, grounded in the verified wire contract:
 *  - MAIN-THREAD ONLY (`parentToolUseId === null`): a sub-agent's Artifact tool_use is replayed
 *    live but SKIPPED on reload (history.rs skip_sidechain), so scoping to the main thread keeps
 *    the list identical live and after a resume.
 *  - GROUP BY file_path (not URL, not label): same conversation + same file_path deterministically
 *    maps to the same URL, but the URL is only known once the tool_result lands — file_path is
 *    known at tool_use time, so it is the stable provisional key that never splits a republish
 *    into two items. Labels repeat across different files, so they are never a key.
 *  - Tool_uses with no file_path (an `action:"list"` or a bare cross-conversation url-update) are
 *    skipped — they don't describe a local publish. (The inline card path mirrors this guard in
 *    `groupBlocks`.)
 *  - An artifact whose EVERY publish terminally FAILED (all versions `is_error`, no URL) is dropped
 *    from this list: it is not an openable artifact, so it must not inflate the "Artifacts (N)" chip
 *    nor sit there mislabelled as "not published yet". The failure is still surfaced in the thread
 *    by <ArtifactCard> (which reads `is_error` and shows the reason). A still-pending publish (no
 *    result yet → not `is_error`) is kept.
