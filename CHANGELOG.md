# Changelog

What's new in each version, **shown in the app** when it updates.

Convention: one `## vX.Y.Z` section per version (most recent on top), with short,
**user-oriented** bullets — no internal technical details. The `/release` skill
automatically adds the new version's section from the commits; `release.yml` reads
that section and uses it as the GitHub release description, which the app displays
as-is. The install instructions block (after the `<!-- gh-only -->` marker) is added
by `release.yml` and stays **only** on the GitHub page — it does not appear in the app.

## v1.1.0

- New anti-sleep control: keep your Mac awake while agents work, with Light and Hard modes, from a toolbar button.
- The "Thinking…" indicator now uses playful, escalating words the longer an agent thinks.
- Open files now refresh correctly when you come back to a conversation.
- Markdown file links from Codex are now clickable.
- The disabled 5-hour window no longer shows up in Claude usage.

## v1.0.0

Flight Deck reaches 1.0 — the headline is Codex.

- Codex (OpenAI) is now supported. When you create a conversation you pick the model between Claude and Codex; the conversation stays on that backend, with its background tasks, sub-agents, and History panel entries all handled just like Claude.
- The whole app is now in English.
- New on Flight Deck cards: delete a conversation straight from its card, stream controls (clean output, start/restart/stop) in the reply modal, and an importance rail that surfaces the cards needing a look.
- AI provider account management: sign in to your OpenAI and Claude accounts from the app and see each one's connection status at a glance.

## v0.28.0

- New PDF viewer built into the editor: zoom, fit-to-width, open in read-only mode.
- Web and markdown links are now clickable in the Flight Deck preview.
- In the conversation, a screenshot read by the agent shows as an image preview instead of its base64 code.
- New "clickable file paths" setting (on by default).
- The background-tasks setting has moved to the General tab of Settings.

## v0.27.0

- Turn duration shown in the conversation, with a live counter while the agent works and a per-item breakdown (model, thinking, tools).
- Interactive Flight Deck cards: task list, context, effort, and to-do stacks viewable directly.
- Plugins and slash-commands of active conversations reload automatically when you enable/disable them.
- An agent that finishes while a background task is running now turns green ("background task running") instead of a misleading "to review" state.
- Fix: sub-agents' internal prompts no longer show up as your own messages in the thread.

## v0.26.0

- More reliable sound notifications: the agent-finished chime fires again even after watching a video or changing the Mac's audio output.
- A new installer renames the bundle to **Flight Deck.app** on first launch.

## v0.25.0

- The app is now called **Flight Deck** and sports a new logo.
- New on-hover message controls: rewind the conversation from a message, or branch off into a new one (fork).
- A floating pin shows your last sent message at the top of the thread.
- Messages keep their line breaks, and the last-message preview ignores internal notifications.
- Fix: a stale usage token no longer hides the balance from the Keychain.

## v0.24.0

- Flight Deck: clickable cards with pop-ups (conversation, last message, to-do) and an enriched overview of the agent fleet.
- Alert when an agent has finished, even if it was running in the background; internal task notifications no longer clutter the thread.
- Composer "+" button: attach files and images to a message.
- Redesigned Settings page, with a keyboard-shortcuts summary (and new shortcuts).
- Confirmation before deleting a **running** conversation (inactive conversations still delete in one click, undoable with ⌘Z).
- Reworked update page: readable version highlights, and a clear warning before restart — including the number of running conversations that will be interrupted.
