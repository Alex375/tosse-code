//! Assembler — turns the raw [`CliMessage`] stream into normalized,
//! UI-facing [`SessionEvent`]s (spec §6.2 "assembler").
//!
//! Design choices for robustness:
//!   - Live typing comes from `stream_event` text/thinking deltas.
//!   - Authoritative content (tool_use blocks, final text) is read from the
//!     top-level `assistant` message, which carries the full `content[]`. We do
//!     NOT reconstruct tool inputs from `input_json_delta` fragments — reading
//!     the assembled block is simpler and less fragile (spec §3.6).
//!   - `stop_reason` / final usage come from the `result` line.
//!
//! The assembler owns the coarse [`SessionStatePayload`]; the session asks it to
//! reflect permission / mode changes so all state lives in one place.
