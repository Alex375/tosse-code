// to the repo's LIVE sessions (VERIFIED: it re-scans the plugin, skills included) and
// refresh the `/` command menu. This module decides WHICH conversations are in scope.

 * - Project (repo) lens: the repo is matched by `target.path`; there is no current
 *   conversation.
 *
 * "Live" means a live Rust session handle is bound (`handle != null`).
 *
 * CLAUDE conversations only: the bar hot-applies a Claude plugin toggle — a
 * settings.json write plus the `reload_plugins` control request, which the Codex actor
 * ignores as a no-op — and refetches the `/` menu by spawning an ephemeral `claude`.
 * A live Codex conversation neither reads settings.json nor answers the request, so
 * counting it would inflate "All live conversations (N)" and claim an
 * application that never happens.
