// Real conversation management: repos (working folders) and the conversations
// the user started in them. Each conversation IS a live `claude` session (one
// spawned process). Conversations are grouped by repo in the sidebar.
//
// Identity: a conversation's `id` is a STABLE uuid generated at creation and
// persisted — it is the identity the whole app keys off and never changes. The
// live Rust session handle (`session-N`) is a SEPARATE, in-memory-only field
// (`handle`) that is remapped on every restart and never persisted. Other
// services can therefore reference a conversation by an id independent of both
// SQL and the transport.
//
// Persistence: repos + conversation metadata (incl. the claude session_id for
// --resume) + the active selection live in the Rust core's SQLite db, behind the
// IPC commands. This store is the in-memory cache + the single persistence
// adapter: each mutation mirrors itself to the core (best-effort, off the hot
// path). The conversation MESSAGES are NOT stored here: on resume we rebuild them
// from Claude's own on-disk transcript via `loadSessionHistory`. `claude --resume`
// does NOT re-stream past messages, so the live event path delivers nothing for an
// existing conversation — reading the transcript is what fills it back in.
