//! The Codex conversation actor — the Codex sibling of `session::run_actor`.
//!
//! One `run_codex_actor` per Codex conversation: it opens a thread on the shared
//! [`CodexServer`], then drives a `select!` loop over the conversation's inbound
//! app-server messages (routed to it by threadId) and the UI's [`SessionCommand`]s,
//! translating BOTH into the SAME normalized [`SessionEvent`]s the Claude backend
//! emits — so the entire front (rendering, status, clean-output) is reused verbatim.
//!
//! The teardown order mirrors `session::run_actor` byte-for-byte in SHAPE (invariant
//! #4): explain a spontaneous death → announce the end → close the thread → evict from
//! the registry → fire the shutdown ack LAST (the synchronous-stop contract a rewind
//! relies on). The SOCLE emits enough to "answer text"; rich item rendering is 4.1.
