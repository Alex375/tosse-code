// An interactive shell keeps its OWN working directory once started — it does not
// follow the agent's `EnterWorktree`/`ExitWorktree` moves (that would yank a real
// terminal out from under the user). So the live `cwd` only seeds the shell at
// creation; the attach effect must NOT re-run when it changes (doing so would tear
// down + re-attach the terminal — and steal focus — on every agent cwd move).

/**
 * The integrated terminal pane. Thin React shell: it owns a container element and,
 * on mount, attaches the conversation's long-lived xterm host into it (creating
 * the terminal + PTY on first use via `ensureTerm`). On unmount it only detaches —
 * the Terminal and its shell keep living, so closing the panel or switching
 * conversations never kills a running command. `stacked` flips the divider edge
 * (top vs left) to match the side region's placement, exactly like the editor.
