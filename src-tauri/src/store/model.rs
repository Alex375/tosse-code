//! Domain records for persisted conversation metadata.
//!
//! These are the types the rest of the core and the IPC layer speak — plain
//! data, no SQL. [`super::db::Store`] is the ONLY place that maps them to and
//! from SQLite rows, so the storage schema can change (or the engine be swapped)
//! without touching a single caller. Field names are snake_case so they mirror
//! the SQL columns and the existing IPC payloads (`SessionStatePayload`); the
//! front maps them to its camelCase domain model at the one persistence boundary.
