// The agent/conversation STATUS model — a rich, UI-agnostic discriminated union
// derived from the raw session signals. This is the SINGLE source of truth for
// "what is this agent doing right now", shared by:
//   - the sidebar status dot + row highlight (this task), and
//   - the upcoming fleet / agent-management view, which renders the SAME status
//     differently and needs the carried context (the pending question, the
//     blocking tool, the error message) — not just a colour.
//
// Keep this module PURE: no React, no store imports beyond the `StreamState`
// colour type. Everything here is unit-testable in isolation (see status.test.ts).
//
// On the hard case — "open question" vs "ready for review": the protocol gives NO
// native signal for "Claude asked a question in plain text and is waiting". An
// open question and a finished statement BOTH end a turn with stop_reason
// "end_turn"/subtype "success" — they are indistinguishable on the wire. The only
// 100%-native question signal is the `AskUserQuestion` tool (a questionnaire). For
// everything else we fall back to a heuristic (`looksLikeQuestion`), and let the
// user dismiss a false positive with the "Seen" button.
