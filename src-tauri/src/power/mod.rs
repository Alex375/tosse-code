//! The single service that holds the macOS "keep awake" power assertion.
//!
//! Same shell-out encapsulation as `usage/` (→ `/usr/bin/security`) and `git/` (→ the
//! `git` binary): the rest of the core and the IPC layer go through `Caffeinate` and
//! never touch `caffeinate` directly, so the mechanism stays swappable (e.g. an IOKit
//! `IOPMAssertionCreateWithName` FFI backend later) without touching a single caller.
//!
//! MECHANISM, not policy. We hold ONE managed `caffeinate -i` child while "awake" is
//! desired and kill it when it isn't — a single assertion for the whole app, not one per
//! conversation. The FRONT owns the policy (the toolbar on/off + the Light/Hard mode +
//! fleet activity): it computes the desired `awake` boolean and pushes it here via the
//! `set_awake` IPC command. This service just spawns/kills accordingly.
//!
//! We pass `-i` (prevent idle SYSTEM sleep — works on battery AND AC) and deliberately
//! NOT `-d` (display): the screen may sleep and the session may lock, only the machine
//! must stay awake. Note `caffeinate` does NOT keep the Mac awake with the lid CLOSED
//! (macOS treats a lid close as an explicit sleep the assertion can't override) — this
//! covers lid-open + screen-off/locked only.
//!
//! TEARDOWN is mandatory: an orphaned `caffeinate` child would hold the Mac awake
//! forever. The app releases explicitly at quit (`RunEvent::Exit`), and `Drop` is a belt
//! in case the managed state is torn down another way — same no-orphan discipline as the
//! terminal service.
