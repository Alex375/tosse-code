// Active `/goal` per conversation. `/goal <condition>` is Claude Code's native goal feature:

// auto-clears. We only DISPLAY it — a target icon on the Flight Deck card and a chip (+ clear
// button) in the composer bar — so the user can see whether a conversation is driving toward a goal.
//
// Read from the on-disk transcript, NOT the live stream: the CLI records goal state as
// `attachment` lines of `type:"goal_status"` that are DISK-ONLY (never emitted on stdout), so
// there is nothing to intercept live. We fetch it from the Rust `load_session_goal`, which scans
// the WHOLE transcript forward — NOT a tail read: a goal set early and never terminated is still
// active at the end of the file, so no suffix would do (a raw-substring pre-filter keeps that
// affordable; see `history.rs::load_active_goal`). Called at conversation load/reload, once per
// Flight Deck card, and on turn edges — but ONLY for conversations that have (or recently had) a
// goal (`goalSeen`), so a fleet of goalless conversations never pays a per-turn transcript read. Kept in memory, keyed by the STABLE
// conversation id; the transcript is its durable source of truth, so nothing to persist. Unlike
// Remote Control, a goal SURVIVES session end (the CLI restores it on `--resume`), so its state is
// only forgotten when the conversation itself is removed (stop/remove/removeRepo/wipe).
