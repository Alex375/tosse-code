// Open/collapsed state of the "Travail de Claude" fold blocks (clean-output mode),
// keyed by conversation id → round key → open. Persisted to localStorage via the shared
// {@link loadJson}/{@link saveJson} helpers (not the SQLite metadata store — this is pure UI
// state, so it stays out of the Rust core, no schema migration).
//
// Why a store and not a plain React useState in ClaudeWorkBlock: the conversation pane
// is remounted per conversation (`key={conv.id}` in ConductorConversation), so any local
// component state resets when you switch away and come back — the fold you opened would
// snap shut. A Zustand store is global and survives that remount, so the fold state
// persists across a conversation switch; localStorage additionally carries it across app
// restarts. Round keys are the assistant round's stable turn id (from the transcript,
// stable across reloads), so a persisted entry re-associates with the right block on
// return; an orphaned key just falls back to collapsed (the default), which is harmless.
