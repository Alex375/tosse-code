// Which placeholder/body a <TaskOutputPopover> shows, decided from the load state.
// Pure + unit-tested so the (null vs "") distinction — the whole point — can't
// silently regress: a background task that produced NO output writes an EMPTY file
// (`read_task_output` → ""), whereas an ABSENT/unreadable file reads back as null.
// Conflating the two is what made the popover claim "no output" when it simply
// hadn't loaded the output. So:
//   - ""   → the file is there and empty → genuinely no output.
//   - null → we don't have it (not read yet, or absent/unreadable) → "unavailable",
//            never asserted as "no output".
