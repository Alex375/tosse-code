// store — the precise percentage is NOT in the stream: it comes from the core's
// `get_plan_usage` command, which replicates the CLI's internal `GET /api/oauth/usage`.
//
// Usage is ACCOUNT-global (not per-conversation), so this is a single shared query.
// Cadence (validated with the user): a 5-min background poll, a refetch when the
// context popover opens (throttled by `staleTime`), and a manual refresh button. The
// endpoint is itself rate-limited, hence the throttling + back-off. Errors are typed
// (UsageError) and surfaced in the popover — never swallowed.
